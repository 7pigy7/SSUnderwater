/* ============================================
   UNDERWATER BUBBLE ANIMATION
   --------------------------------------------
   File: _bubbles.scss
   Description:
   Creates floating bubbles that move upward with
   varying sizes, opacity, and speed — resembling
   underwater air bubbles.
   Only visible on desktop view (hidden on mobile).
   ============================================ */

   /* Notes from Shauntal - I think it will be a bit tricky to add bubbles this way
   because you can't create a class for them. They will need to be added via using ::before or ::after.
   I know that is not ideal and not what we usually do, it would be so nice if we could just change the HTML
   but that would go against the assignment, and we don't want to lose marks. I would suggest using the
   .page-footer for your parent folder and the .container as your child. That is the footer at the bottom of the
   web site. This way you can add the bubbles at the bottom and have them still rise to the top, if you still want
   to do that. If not, I understand!!!! Just adding a few under each title and having the static would be awesome
   as well. However, I would suggest NOT using the h1 for the ::before and ::after because I have already used those
   to add the little sea animals.*/
